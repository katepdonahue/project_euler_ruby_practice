# I have an array stockPricesYesterday where the keys

# and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time. 
# For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
# Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit 
# I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday.
